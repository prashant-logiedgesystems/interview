What is the MERN stack and what are its components
Ans  That's correct! The MERN stack is a popular web development stack that uses MongoDB for the database, 
     Express for the web framework, React for the frontend framework, and Node.js for the server runtime environment. 
      Together, these technologies provide a full-stack solution for building modern web applications.
