Why javascript is single Threaded?
Ans : 1.JavaScript is single threaded because it was designed to run in a browser environment 
      2.where the main thread is responsible for handling user interactions, rendering the UI, and executing JavaScript code.
      3.Running JavaScript on a single thread ensures that the browser remains responsive to user interactions and 
        that JavaScript code execution does not interfere with other browser activities.


            Single Threaded give Benefits:
            1.Simplicity: JavaScript was designed to be an easy-to-use language for web developers, and the single-threaded model 
            is simple to understand and work with. It makes it easier to write and debug code since there is only one execution 
            context and no need to manage multiple threads.

            2.Safety: By limiting JavaScript to a single thread, there is no need to worry about race conditions, deadlocks, and 
            other synchronization issues that can arise when multiple threads access and modify the same data. This makes it 
            easier to write reliable and predictable code.

            3.Browser compatibility: The browser environment is the primary target for JavaScript, and 
                most browsers are single-threaded. By designing JavaScript to be single-threaded, it is
                easier to ensure compatibility across different browsers and operating systems.

            4.Security: Single-threading can help improve security by preventing malicious code from accessing data or 
            executing code in unexpected ways. This is especially important in a web environment where scripts from
            different sources can run on the same page



Why javascript not Multi-Threaded?
Ans : 1.Unlike other programming languages, such as Java or C++, which have built-in support for multi-threading
      2.JavaScript's event-driven architecture and its use of callbacks and 
      event listeners make it possible to achieve concurrency without the need for multi-threading.

Note:
Additionally, allowing multiple threads to access and modify the same data in JavaScript can lead to 
            race conditions (
                A race condition occurs when two threads access a shared variable at the same time
            ), 
where different threads may access or modify the same data at the same time, leading to unpredictable and 
potentially erroneous behavior.
