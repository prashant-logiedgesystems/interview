what is a setTimeOut;
Ans  syntec:  setTimeOut(()=>{},time(in milli second also calle theshold));
            This function is used to execute a piece of code once after a specified delay (in milliseconds). 
            The delay is specified as the second argument to the function. For example, the following code will
             execute the function myFunction() after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (or 2 seconds):

                setTimeout(myFunction, 2000);


what is a setInterval;
Ans  syntec:  setInterval(()=>{},time(in milli second));
            This function is used to execute a piece of code repeatedly at fixed intervals (also in milliseconds). 
            The delay is specified as the second argument to the function, just like setTimeout()


what is setImmediate()?
Ans :setImmediate() is actually a special timer that runs in a separate phase of the event loop. 
     It uses a libuv API that schedules callbacks to execute after the poll phase has completed.

Note:
        setImmediate() and setTimeout() are similar, but behave in different ways depending on when they are called.

        setImmediate() is designed to execute a script once the current poll phase completes.
        setTimeout() schedules a script to be run after a minimum threshold in ms has elapsed.
