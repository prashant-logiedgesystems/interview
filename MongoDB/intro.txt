WHAT IS Aggregation Pipeline?

    In MongoDB, the Aggregation Pipeline is a set of stages that allow you to filter, transform, and 
    analyze data in a collection. Each stage in the pipeline performs a specific operation on the data,
    such as filtering, grouping, sorting, and calculating aggregate values.

    The Aggregation Pipeline is comprised of several stages, each of which takes a set of documents as input,
    performs some operation on them, and then passes the output to the next stage. The final output is the result
    of all the stages in the pipeline

    Some common stages used in the Aggregation Pipeline include:

        $match: Filters documents based on a specified condition.
        $group: Groups documents together based on a specified key and performs aggregate calculations on the grouped documents.
        $project: Modifies the document fields and includes or excludes fields from the output.
        $sort: Sorts documents based on a specified field.
