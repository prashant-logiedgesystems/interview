problem  with RDBMS
 . should know the entire schema upfront
 . Every record should have the same properties
 .Altering schema on a running database is expensive
 .application changes for any change in schema structure
 . SOL is designed for running only for single server system
 . Horizontal Scalability is a problem
 . Scalability is costly [transaction and join are expensice when running on a distributed database]
 . Many Relational databases do not provide out of the box support of scaling
 . Normalization [
                 .it is a technique for desinging the RDBMS for minimising the duplicate of information
                 .Normalization is also termed as canical synthesis
                 .it used to keep data consistent and check that no loss of data or data integrity( Data integrity is the accuracy ,completeness,
                  and quality of data ,data integrity is not same as security ,because data security involve in protecting data from externa and internal
                  threat and maintaince the privacy,this contribute data integrity by ensuring it has not been compromised by those threats)
                    ]

 .Fixed schema make it hard to adjust to application needs
