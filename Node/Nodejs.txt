in simple word : Node.js is Server-side scripting which is used to build scalable programs. It is a web application framework built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine

1 what is Node js
Ans : * Nodejs is a single threaded runtime environment which means it uses the single thread to execute the javascript code,and it doesn't mean only 
     run one task at a time
     * Node  js uses the event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O model ,that allow to handle multiple concurrent operation efficiently
     *When an I/O operation is initiated in Node.js, it is scheduled in the event loop and the thread  moves on to the next operation without waiting for the previous operation to complete. Once the I/O operation is complete, the callback associated with it is added to the event loop for execution.

oues How many types of API functions are available in Node.js?
     There are two types of API functions in Node.js:

     Asynchronous, Non-blocking functions
     Synchronous, Blocking functions

2.Non-Blocking(async)v/s Blocking(sync):

   in Blocking I/O (sync): code execute line vise line 
                         ex:
                              1 const fs=require('fs');
                              2 const text=fs.readFileSync('data.txt','utf-8);// file is reading synchronously 
                              3 console.log("message done",text);// this will not execute until or unless line 2 code does'nt    execute completely

   in Non-Blocking I/O (sync): the execution of one task does not wait for the completion of another task,
                              but instead, the program continues executing other tasks while the first task is in progress.
                         ex:
                              1 const fs=require('fs');
                              2 const text=fs.readFile('data.txt','utf-8, // after file read completely the our callback will execute so till that time asynchronous code will present in libuv 
                              (err,data)=>{
                                console.log("data",data);
                              }
                              );
                              3 console.log("message done",text);// this will not execute until or unless line 2 code does'nt    execute completely

   Note: ^ synchronous code has more priority then asynchronous code
         ^ asynchronous programming is achieved using callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. 
         ^ These mechanisms allow developers to write code that appears to execute synchronously,while actually executing    asynchronously in the background. This approach can improve the responsiveness and performance of applications, 
           particularly those that involve complex I/O operations or user interactions

Event Loop == ( it is just a c program)== (The event loop is a critical component of the Node.js runtime that enables asynchronous programming and non-blocking I/O operations)
